== Description ==

[<strong>Live Demo</strong>](https://demo.codewoogeek.online/back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce/)

<strong>Back In Stock Notifier</strong> is a WooCommerce Waitlist Pro Plugin which displays the Email Subscription form in frontend when a product is Out of Stock. When Product Back in Stock, this plugin will notifies the subscribers by email in a background process. Many of the existing plugins are loop through the subscribers to send mail so here there is many chance it will either fail/timeout. This plugin is designed to overcome this problem by sending a mail using background process, so that it will not fail till the completion of loop, by this you can turn your subscribers to customers.

== Supported Product Types of WooCommerce == 
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Variable</li>
<li>Grouped</li>
<li>Simple Subscription(From WooCommerce)</li>
<li>Variable Subscription(From WooCommerce)</li>
<li>Product Bundle(From WooCommerce)</li>
</ul>

We designed this product to manage subscribers in one place and what happen if we send instock mail for 10000+ subscribers, definitely server will crash or timeout issue/sometime duplicate mail to be sent to the subscribers.

We designed this plugin to overcome this situation by sending a mail in a background means asynchronous way so that mail will be sent to the respective user without any issue.

== Something Went Wrong Error ==

We use one layer of security to our ajax request which is WP Nonce – but due to caching mechanism from third party plugins/hosting this security nonce also cached which cause this error “something went wrong, please try again after some time”, some cases by setting up cache timeout in plugin settings reduce this kind of issue.

<strong>How to get rid of this error?</strong>
-----------------------------

From version 2.0 we added different techniques to avoid Something Went Wrong Error - If your site has encounter such issues we suggest you to try the below steps to get rid of Something Went Wrong Error

1. Go to Admin Dashboard -> Instock Notifier -> Settings -> Troubleshoot Settings Section -> Frontend Subscribe Form Submission via 
It has two option one is WordPress AJAX(default)  and another one is WordPress REST API Route

Try change that option to WordPress REST API Route and check it out(purge your cache and check it out).

2. If the above steps not helpful then follow the another method which is Google reCAPTCHA v3(Invisible Recaptcha) - For that you need Site key and Secret Key of v3 - Go to Admin Dashboard -> Instock Notifier -> Settings -> Google reCAPTCHA Settings -> Enable Google reCAPTCHA and Choose Version -> V3 followed by Site Key and Secret Key(both fields required in order to function properly)

3. If v3 not helps try v2 of Google reCAPTCHA 

== How to override/create custom template for front-end subscribe form? ==

1. Create a folder inside  your current theme in the name of back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce . For example:wordpress->wp-content->themes->storefront/(your theme)->back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce

2. Go to our plugin folder then inside find the templates folder. (wordpress -> wp-content -> plugins -> back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce -> templates -> default-form.php)

3. Open the templates folder and copy the file with the name of default-form.php file inside that folder.

4. Now paste the copied file inside your theme under the folder name of back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce(step 1).

5. That's all now you've successfully loaded the template from theme - here you can edit whatever you want.


== Automatic Instock Email support for Third-party Stock Management from v2.4 ==

Not all site owners manage stock inside the website, some of them manage their stock through third-party inventory management, the problem with our plugin is Automatic Instock Email not triggered/detected, because some third-party software directly updates stock into the database. 

From v2.4 we methodologically implemented to keep supporting Third-party stock management to send our Automatic Instock Email. Do the following things - If you manage stock from third party inventory

Go to Admin Dashboard -> Instock Notifier -> Settings -> Troubleshoot Section -> Enable this option if you have updated the stock from a third-party inventory plugin ->Enable that checkbox option and save changes.

Now we check the product every five minutes to trigger our Automatic Instock Email when the stock status becomes "In Stock"



== REST API Support ==
From Version 2.0 - We added support for REST API using that you can create/update/get/delete subscribers. For that you need Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

<strong>How to generate Consumer key and Consumer Secret?</strong>
-------------------------------------------------
We enforce our plugin to work on top of WooCommerce hence the credentials created from woocommerce(consumer key and consumer secret) can also used for our REST API Endpoint to perform different actions. Go to WooCommerce -> Advanced -> REST API -> Create Keys(with read/write permissions)

<strong>What are the endpoints provided from your plugin?</strong>
-------------------------------------------------
We created documentation for REST API which you can check it here [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15423262/TzJrDfTe](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15423262/TzJrDfTe)
